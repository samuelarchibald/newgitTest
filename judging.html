        <p>Not many people can design well, but everyone can tell when something looks bad. Your app needs to look so good that even if it didn’t work, people would still download it just to marvel at it. We look for an app that is starting trends instead of following them. These are some good questions to ask about your app’s design: Is everything aligned correctly? Does anything stand out that shouldn’t? Is the color scheme consistent throughout the whole app? If you gave a confident ‘YES’ to all those questions, you’re on the right track.</p>
